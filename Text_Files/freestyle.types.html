processed. class freestyle.types. ChainingIterator  Class hierarchy: Iterator > ViewEdgeIterator > ChainingIterator Base class for chaining iterators. This class is designed to be
overloaded in order to describe chaining rules. It makes the
description of chaining rules easier. The two main methods that need
to overloaded are traverse() and init(). traverse() tells which ViewEdge to follow, among the adjacent ones. If you specify
restriction rules (such as “Chain only ViewEdges of the selection”),
they will be included in the adjacency iterator (i.e, the adjacent
iterator will only stop on “valid” edges). __init__ ( restrict_to_selection = True , restrict_to_unvisited = True , begin = None , orientation = True )  __init__ ( brother ) Builds a Chaining Iterator from the first ViewEdge used for
iteration and its orientation or by using the copy constructor. Parameters : restrict_to_selection ( bool ) – Indicates whether to force the chaining
to stay within the set of selected ViewEdges or not. restrict_to_unvisited ( bool ) – Indicates whether a ViewEdge that has
already been chained must be ignored ot not. begin ( ViewEdge or None) – The ViewEdge from which to start the chain. orientation ( bool ) – The direction to follow to explore the graph. If
true, the direction indicated by the first ViewEdge is used. brother ( ChainingIterator ) – init ( )  Initializes the iterator context. This method is called each
time a new chain is started. It can be used to reset some
history information that you might want to keep. traverse ( it )  This method iterates over the potential next ViewEdges and returns
the one that will be followed next. Returns the next ViewEdge to
follow or None when the end of the chain is reached. Parameters : it ( AdjacencyIterator ) – The iterator over the ViewEdges adjacent to the end vertex
of the current ViewEdge. The adjacency iterator reflects the
restriction rules by only iterating over the valid ViewEdges. Returns : Returns the next ViewEdge to follow, or None if chaining ends. Return type : ViewEdge or None is_incrementing  True if the current iteration is an incrementation. Type : bool next_vertex  The ViewVertex that is the next crossing.

of a 1D curve (it doesn’t have to be a vertex of the curve). Any Interface1D is built upon ViewEdges, themselves built upon
FEdges. Therefore, a curve is basically a polyline made of a list of SVertex objects. Thus, a CurvePoint is built by linearly
interpolating two SVertex instances. CurvePoint can be used
as virtual points while querying 0D information along a curve at a
given resolution. __init__ ( )  __init__ ( brother ) __init__ ( first_vertex , second_vertex , t2d ) __init__ ( first_point , second_point , t2d ) Builds a CurvePoint using the default constructor, copy constructor,
or one of the overloaded constructors. The over loaded constructors
can either take two SVertex or two CurvePoint objects and an interpolation parameter Parameters : brother ( CurvePoint ) – A CurvePoint object. first_vertex ( SVertex ) – The first SVertex. second_vertex ( SVertex ) – The second SVertex. first_point ( CurvePoint ) – The first CurvePoint. second_point ( CurvePoint ) – The second CurvePoint. t2d ( float ) – A 2D interpolation parameter used to linearly interpolate

through the .object attribute. __init__ ( )  __init__ ( brother ) __init__ ( step = 0.0 ) Builds a CurvePointIterator object using either the default constructor,
copy constructor, or the overloaded constructor. Parameters : brother ( CurvePointIterator ) – A CurvePointIterator object. step ( float ) – A resampling resolution with which the curve is resampled.

initial vertices). object  The CurvePoint object currently pointed by this iterator. Type : CurvePoint t  The curvilinear abscissa of the current point. Type : float u  The point parameter at the current point in the stroke (0 <= u <= 1). Type : float class freestyle.types. FEdge  Class hierarchy: Interface1D > FEdge Base Class for feature edges. This FEdge can represent a silhouette,
a crease, a ridge/valley, a border or a suggestive contour. For
silhouettes, the FEdge is oriented so that the visible face lies on
the left of the edge. For borders, the FEdge is oriented so that the
face lies on the left of the edge. An FEdge can represent an initial
edge of the mesh or runs across a face of the initial mesh depending
on the smoothness or sharpness of the mesh. This class is specialized
into a smooth and a sharp version since their properties slightly vary
from one to the other. FEdge ( )  FEdge ( brother ) Builds an FEdge using the default constructor,

this FEdge is the last of the ViewEdge. Type : FEdge previous_fedge  The FEdge preceding this one in the ViewEdge. The value is None if
this FEdge is the first one of the ViewEdge. Type : FEdge second_svertex  The second SVertex constituting this FEdge. Type : SVertex viewedge  The ViewEdge to which this FEdge belongs to. Type : ViewEdge class freestyle.types. FEdgeSharp  Class hierarchy: Interface1D > FEdge > FEdgeSharp Class defining a sharp FEdge. A Sharp FEdge corresponds to an initial
edge of the input mesh. It can be a silhouette, a crease or a border.
If it is a crease edge, then it is bordered by two faces of the mesh.
Face a lies on its right whereas Face b lies on its left. If it is a
border edge, then it doesn’t have any face on its right, and thus Face
a is None. __init__ ( )  __init__ ( brother ) __init__ ( first_vertex , second_vertex ) Builds an FEdgeSharp using the default constructor,
copy constructor, or between two SVertex objects. Parameters : brother ( FEdgeSharp ) – An FEdgeSharp object. first_vertex ( SVertex ) – The first SVertex object. second_vertex ( SVertex ) – The second SVertex object. face_mark_left  The face mark of the face lying on the left of the FEdge. Type : bool face_mark_right  The face mark of the face lying on the right of the FEdge. If this FEdge
is a border, it has no face on the right and thus this property is set to

is a border, it has no Face on its right and therefore no material. Type : Material normal_left  The normal to the face lying on the left of the FEdge. Type : mathutils.Vector normal_right  The normal to the face lying on the right of the FEdge. If this FEdge
is a border, it has no Face on its right and therefore no normal. Type : mathutils.Vector class freestyle.types. FEdgeSmooth  Class hierarchy: Interface1D > FEdge > FEdgeSmooth Class defining a smooth edge. This kind of edge typically runs across
a face of the input mesh. It can be a silhouette, a ridge or valley,
a suggestive contour. __init__ ( )  __init__ ( brother ) __init__ ( first_vertex , second_vertex ) Builds an FEdgeSmooth using the default constructor,

Operators  Class defining the operators used in a style module. There are five
types of operators: Selection, chaining, splitting, sorting and
creation. All these operators are user controlled through functors,
predicates and shaders that are taken as arguments. static bidirectional_chain ( it , pred )  static bidirectional_chain ( it ) Builds a set of chains from the current set of ViewEdges. Each
ViewEdge of the current list potentially starts a new chain. The
chaining operator then iterates over the ViewEdges of the ViewMap
using the user specified iterator. This operator iterates both using
the increment and decrement operators and is therefore bidirectional.
This operator works with a ChainingIterator which contains the
chaining rules. It is this last one which can be told to chain only
edges that belong to the selection or not to process twice a ViewEdge
during the chaining. Each time a ViewEdge is added to a chain, its
chaining time stamp is incremented. This allows you to keep track of
the number of chains to which a ViewEdge belongs to. Parameters : it ( ChainingIterator ) – The ChainingIterator on the ViewEdges of the ViewMap. It
contains the chaining rule. pred ( UnaryPredicate1D ) – The predicate on the ViewEdge that expresses the stopping condition.
This parameter is optional, you make not want to pass a stopping criterion
when the stopping criterion is already contained in the iterator definition. static chain ( it , pred , modifier )  static chain ( it , pred ) Builds a set of chains from the current set of ViewEdges. Each
ViewEdge of the current list starts a new chain. The chaining
operator then iterates over the ViewEdges of the ViewMap using the
user specified iterator. This operator only iterates using the
increment operator and is therefore unidirectional. Parameters : it ( ViewEdgeIterator ) – The iterator on the ViewEdges of the ViewMap. It contains
the chaining rule. pred ( UnaryPredicate1D ) – The predicate on the ViewEdge that expresses the
stopping condition. modifier ( UnaryFunction1DVoid ) – A function that takes a ViewEdge as argument and
that is used to modify the processed ViewEdge state (the
timestamp incrementation is a typical illustration of such a modifier).
If this argument is not given, the time stamp is automatically managed. static create ( pred , shaders )  Creates and shades the strokes from the current set of chains. A
predicate can be specified to make a selection pass on the chains. Parameters : pred ( UnaryPredicate1D ) – The predicate that a chain must verify in order to be
transform as a stroke. shaders (list of StrokeShader objects) – The list of shaders used to shade the strokes. static get_chain_from_index ( i )  Returns the Chain at the index in the current set of Chains. Parameters : i ( int ) – index (0 <= i < Operators.get_chains_size()). Returns : The Chain object. Return type : Chain static get_chains_size ( )  Returns the number of Chains. Returns : The number of Chains. Return type : int static get_stroke_from_index ( i )  Returns the Stroke at the index in the current set of Strokes. Parameters : i ( int ) – index (0 <= i < Operators.get_strokes_size()). Returns : The Stroke object. Return type : Stroke static get_strokes_size ( )  Returns the number of Strokes. Returns : The number of Strokes. Return type : int static get_view_edges_size ( )  Returns the number of ViewEdges. Returns : The number of ViewEdges. Return type : int static get_viewedge_from_index ( i )  Returns the ViewEdge at the index in the current set of ViewEdges. Parameters : i ( int ) – index (0 <= i < Operators.get_view_edges_size()). Returns : The ViewEdge object. Return type : ViewEdge static recursive_split ( func , pred_1d , sampling = 0.0 )  static recursive_split ( func , pred_0d , pred_1d , sampling = 0.0 ) Splits the current set of chains in a recursive way. We process the
points of each chain (with a specified sampling) to find the point
minimizing a specified function. The chain is split in two at this
point and the two new chains are processed in the same way. The
recursivity level is controlled through a predicate 1D that expresses
a stopping condition on the chain that is about to be processed. The user can also specify a 0D predicate to make a first selection on the points
that can potentially be split. A point that doesn’t verify the 0D
predicate won’t be candidate in realizing the min. Parameters : func ( UnaryFunction0DDouble ) – The Unary Function evaluated at each point of the chain.
The splitting point is the point minimizing this function. pred_0d ( UnaryPredicate0D ) – The Unary Predicate 0D used to select the candidate
points where the split can occur. For example, it is very likely
that would rather have your chain splitting around its middle
point than around one of its extremities. A 0D predicate working
on the curvilinear abscissa allows to add this kind of constraints. pred_1d ( UnaryPredicate1D ) – The Unary Predicate expressing the recursivity stopping
condition. This predicate is evaluated for each curve before it
actually gets split. If pred_1d(chain) is true, the curve won’t be
split anymore. sampling ( float ) – The resolution used to sample the chain for the
predicates evaluation. (The chain is not actually resampled; a
virtual point only progresses along the curve using this
resolution.) static reset ( delete_strokes = True )  Resets the line stylization process to the initial state. The results of
stroke creation are accumulated if delete_strokes is set to False. Parameters : delete_strokes ( bool ) – Delete the strokes that are currently stored. static select ( pred )  Selects the ViewEdges of the ViewMap verifying a specified
condition. Parameters : pred ( UnaryPredicate1D ) – The predicate expressing this condition. static sequential_split ( starting_pred , stopping_pred , sampling = 0.0 )  static sequential_split ( pred , sampling = 0.0 ) Splits each chain of the current set of chains in a sequential way.
The points of each chain are processed (with a specified sampling)
sequentially. The first point of the initial chain is the
first point of one of the resulting chains. The splitting ends when
no more chain can start. Tip By specifying a starting and stopping predicate allows
the chains to overlap rather than chains partitioning. Parameters : starting_pred ( UnaryPredicate0D ) – The predicate on a point that expresses the
starting condition. Each time this condition is verified, a new chain begins stopping_pred ( UnaryPredicate0D ) – The predicate on a point that expresses the
stopping condition. The chain ends as soon as this predicate is verified. pred ( UnaryPredicate0D ) – The predicate on a point that expresses the splitting condition.
Each time the condition is verified, the chain is split into two chains.
The resulting set of chains is a partition of the initial chain sampling ( float ) – The resolution used to sample the chain for the
predicates evaluation. (The chain is not actually resampled;
a virtual point only progresses along the curve using this
resolution.) static sort ( pred )  Sorts the current set of chains (or viewedges) according to the

orientedViewEdgeIterator allows to iterate in CCW order over these
ViewEdges and to get the orientation for each ViewEdge
(incoming/outgoing). Returns : An orientedViewEdgeIterator pointing to the first ViewEdge. Return type : orientedViewEdgeIterator edges_end ( )  Returns an orientedViewEdgeIterator over the ViewEdges around this
ViewVertex, pointing after the last ViewEdge. Returns : An orientedViewEdgeIterator pointing after the last ViewEdge. Return type : orientedViewEdgeIterator edges_iterator ( edge )  Returns an orientedViewEdgeIterator pointing to the ViewEdge given
as argument. Parameters : edge ( ViewEdge ) – A ViewEdge object. Returns : An orientedViewEdgeIterator pointing to the given ViewEdge. Return type : orientedViewEdgeIterator nature  The nature of this ViewVertex. Type : Nature class freestyle.types. orientedViewEdgeIterator  Class hierarchy: Iterator > orientedViewEdgeIterator Class representing an iterator over oriented ViewEdges around a ViewVertex . This iterator allows a CCW iteration (in the image
plane). An instance of an orientedViewEdgeIterator can only be
obtained from a ViewVertex by calling edges_begin() or edges_end(). __init__ ( )  __init__ ( iBrother ) Creates an orientedViewEdgeIterator using either the
default constructor or the copy constructor. Parameters : iBrother ( orientedViewEdgeIterator ) – An orientedViewEdgeIterator object. object  The oriented ViewEdge (i.e., a tuple of the pointed ViewEdge and a boolean
value) currently pointed to by this iterator. If the boolean value is true,
the ViewEdge is incoming. Type : ( ViewEdge , bool) Previous Next © Copyright Blender Authors. Revision f753cf14fca2 - 03/01/2024 . 4.0 Versions Loading...
